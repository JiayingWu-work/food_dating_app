<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We started this project while taking Software Development course(COMP225, fall 2021) at Macalester College. Currently, we are developing the project as independent project and aim to launch the app by the end of 2022. 

Clink is a connection matching/dating app with a food-based twist. During the pandemic, we heard many complains of have no friends nearby to hangout/have dinner with. We also spotted the gap between building connections just by common interests and finding romantic connections in existing dating apps. 

So here is the solution: choose your restaurant preferences out of the restaurants around Macalester and find someone interested to go food hunting with! 

Despite Flutter being a cross-platform tool, we have currently only had time to implement the app in ISO, so please be patient as we potentially extend compatibilities and features in the future! Currently, the project will be centered by restaurants around Macalester College (Saint Paul, MN), but we look forward to scale up once the MVP has a success in the market. Please contact us if you are interested in helping us speed up or scale up the project!
