# food_dating_app

Made by Hengrui Jia, Ned Mayo, Jiaying Wu, and James Yang for Software Development (COMP225), Clink is a dating app with a food-based twist. Choose your restaurant preferences out of the restaurants around Macalester and find someone interested to go with!

Despite Flutter being a cross-platform tool, we have currently only had time to implement the app in ios, so please be patient as we potentially extend compatabilities and features in the future!
